# hlee_kustomer_challenge

In this technical challenge, raw data needed to be downloaded and converted to `JSON`, in order to be uploaded to Kustomer.
The code found in `data6.rb` imports `data.csv` and convert the each row in the csv file into a hash.  The values in this hash are aligned with the keys that Kustomer accepts.  Some logic was written during this process.  Once a new hash is created `created_json` it is uploaded to Kustomer.  This process occurs element by element.  The running the `runner.rb` file will execute the code.
